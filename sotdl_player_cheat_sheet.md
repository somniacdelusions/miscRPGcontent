# Shadow of the Demon Lord
## Player Cheat Sheet
___

### How the system works

* **Challenge Roll**: Roll 1d20 + attribute modifier + **boons** or - **banes**. 10+ succeeds.
* **Attack Roll**: Same as **challenge roll**, but must be ≥ opponent's defense or relevant attribute.
* **Boons**: Roll a d6 for each **boon**; the highest roll  from the **boons** is added to the d20. Relevant professions can grant you boons!
* **Banes**: Like **boons** but subtracted from the roll.

#### Damage
When you take **damage**, your **damage** score goes up, your Health does not go down. **Damage** can be healed by resting, character talents, and magic.

* When **damage** ≥ 1/2 your Health, you are injured; inform the GM. 
* When **damage** = Health, you are incapacitated and may die.

#### Insanity and Corruption
You gain **Insanity** when you experience terrible things; you gain **Corruption** when you do terrible things.

* When you gain **Insanity**, you become frightened for rounds = your **Insanity** total. When frightened, all rolls get a bane and you cannot take fast turns. When your **Insanity** = your Intellect, you may go mad; inform the GM. You can reduce **Insanity** by resting, taking quirks, going mad, and through magic.
* When you gain **Corruption**, roll 1d20. If result <br> is < your **Corruption**, you gain a Mark of Darkness. If your **Corruption** is 4+, you experience negative effects; see core book page 36.

#### Casting spells
Table on core book page 112  gives spell castings. Note that this is castings for *each spell per day*, not spell slots per day. For example, if you know two rank 0 spells and have Power 2, you can cast each of those spells three times.

* You must have some sort of magic implement to cast a spell.
* You regain castings by resting. Some traditions have additional requirements to regain castings, such as the *Forbidden* tradition.

```
```
<br>
#### Frightening and Horrifying creatures

* When you encounter a **frightening** creature, make a Will challenge roll to avoid being frightened for a number of rounds = 1d3 + your Insanity.
* When you encounter a **horrifying** creature,  make a Will challenge roll to avoid gaining Insanity. Regardless of the roll's outcome, all attacks against **horrifying** creatures gain 1 bane.

#### Fortune:
You may gain **Fortune** points through play. 

These can be spent at any time for one of the following benefts:
* Turn your d20 roll into a success
* Grant 2 boons to another character's roll
* Turn a d6 roll result into a 6

Some GMs may also allow **Fortune** spends to make small narrative changes to the scene ("Can I spend a **Fortune** to say that the guard and I are old friends?").

#### Triggered Actions:
You get 1 **triggered action** each round. It can be used for specific actions with a **trigger** that activates it. Creatures can use following as a **triggered action**:

* Free Attack: When a creature moves out of your reach (**trigger**) you may make an attack against it using a melee weapon.
